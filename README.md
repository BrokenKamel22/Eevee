# Eevee

## About

Eevee is a general-purpose Discord bot that's easy to set up and use locally! It comes with a wide variety of commands and configurations that allow it to be used by anyone for anything! This repository is an open-source project built primarily with the [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) framework and [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/) library. It is written in *JavaScrip* and currently maintained by [Kwon25](https://github.com/Kwon25).

Eevee is still in development with new commands, bug fixes, and updates being implemented regularly. Feel free to use any files written here for your projects. If you have any questions about this repository, they can be directed to Bryce Kwon (the author) at Bryce.kwon03@gmail.com or through an issue forum [here](https://github.com/Kwon25/Eevee/issues).
