# Eevee Security Policy

Eevee and its developers would like to ensure it stays on top of all possible vulnerabilities. We are devoted to creating a safe environment for all users.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| < 1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting Requirements

A security report should demonstrate a security bug directly from the source code of this repository.

Vulnerabilities caused by misconfigurations are out of scope. It is entirely possible for a user to craft and use an unsafe configuration, just like with many other applications; we recommend against doing that.

Vulnerabilities found in package dependencies are out of scope. If a dependency is found to have a relevant security bug, feel free to open a public issue forum [here](https://github.com/Kwon25/Eevee/issues) or initiate a pull request [here](https://github.com/Kwon25/Eevee/pulls) to update our code.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

First, please ensure your report falls within the accepted scope of security bugs (above). This will ensure we are not overwhelmed with false or incorrect reports.

In order to properly process the bug and make the appropriate patches, we will need an adequate amount of information. To speed things up, please include:

* The minimal possible configuration (without redactions).
* Specific command(s)
* Full log output
* The specific steps needed to reproduce the issue.
* A working patch (if possible).

Reports that are not actionable, do not contain enough information, or are not able to prove their vulnerability may be deferred to a later time or ignored, depending on available resources. Priority will be given to credible, responsible constructive, specific, and actionable reports. Thank you for your understanding.

When you are ready to submit a report, please email Bryce Kwon (the author) directly: Bryce.kwon03@gmail.com. You will receive a response regarding its status as soon as possible.

Please also understand that we do not have a budget to award security bounties due to our nature as an open-source project. We can only thank you.

If your report is valid and a patch is released, we will not reveal your identity by default. If you wish to be credited, please give us the name/username to use. If you don't provide this information, we can't credit you.

*Thank you for helping Eevee stay safe and secure!*
